# Automated-Student-Registration-System
It is my first Project of backend. Used Java as Programming language and used SQL as database to store all the data. Admin password and username has been hardcode . Admin username = "username" and password = "password".
Separate functions created for both Admin and Student so both have different responsibilities and access.
